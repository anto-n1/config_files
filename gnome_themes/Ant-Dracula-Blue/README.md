# Ant-Dracula-Blue
I really like the overall impact of Ant-Dracula theme except one thing: the pink colour... so i changed to blue!
#### In short
Ant-Dracula-Blue is the original Ant-Dracula theme where the pink components are replaced with blue.<br>
I tested only Gnome 3.26, but it should works also for others Gtk-Based DE! 
#### How to install
Remember to create the __.themes__ folder inside your home if not exists!<br>
The terminal way:

    git clone https://github.com/Michedev/Ant-Dracula-Blue.git
    mv Ant-Dracula-Blue ~/.themes
    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Ant-Dracula-Blue"
    
 The GUI way:
 - Click on green button "Clone or Download" then click "Download Zip"
 - Extract zip
 - Copy folder inside .themes
 - Open Gnome Tweak Tools if you Gnome and set Ant-Dracula-Blue as your theme or use your DE specific tool to set as theme "Ant-Dracula-Blue"
